## NICE-SLAM: Neural Implicit Scalable Encoding for SLAM
In 2022, Zhu et al. proposed NICE-SLAM that incorporates multi-level local information, 
and introducing neural implicit representations 
makes the dense SLAM system more scalable, efficient, and robust.
However, NICE-SLAM still has some issues presented in our report. 
To improve the orignal NICE-SLAM architecture, 
we propose Sign-Agnostic Dynamic SLAM (SAD-SLAM). 
The objective of our project is to 
* optimize mapping and tracking, and
* remove dynamic objects.
<br />
We validate our proposed SAD-SLAM on some datasets and experiments. 
Please refer to the three individual directory to see our work. 
Thank you.

## Experiments
To validate NICE-SLAM and our proposed methods, we used Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera D435i, an RGB-D camera, to compare the results. 
Please change the current working directory to ```experiment``` and see the ```README.md``` for more information.
